  '''Given an array with repeated elements, the task is to find the maximum distance between two occurrences of an element.

Example 1:

Input
n= 6
arr = {1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1}

Output
5

Explanation
arr[] = {1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1}
Max Distance: 5
Distance for 1 is: 5-0 = 5
Distance for 2 is : 4-2 = 2
Max Distance 5
Example 2:

Input
n = 12
arr = {3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 5, 8, 6, 7, 4, 2}

Output
10

Explanation



arr[] = {3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 5, 8, 6, 7, 4, 2}
Max Distance 10
maximum distance for 2 is 11-1 = 10
maximum distance for 1 is 4-2 = 2
maximum distance for 4 is 10-5 = 5 '''
