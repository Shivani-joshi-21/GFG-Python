'''
Given an array of size N consisting of only 0's and 1's. The array is sorted in such a manner that all the 1's are placed first and then they are followed by all the 0's. Find the count of all the 0's.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 12
Arr[] = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0}
Output: 3
Explanation: There are 3 0's in the given array.

        for i in arr:
