'''Given two sorted arrays of distinct elements. There is only 1 difference between the arrays. First array has one element extra added in between. Find the index of the extra element.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 7
A[] = {2,4,6,8,9,10,12}
B[] = {2,4,6,8,10,12}
Output: 4
Explanation: In the second array, 9 is
missing and it's index in the first array
is 4.'''
